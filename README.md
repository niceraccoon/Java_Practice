# Java Problem Solving

This repository contains solutions to various problems implemented in Java.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of Java programs solving different problems. Each problem is implemented in a separate Java file for clarity and organization.

## Folder Structure

- Each problem solution is contained within its own Java file.
- Files are named descriptively to indicate the problem they solve.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions provided in this repository. You can clone the repository locally and run the Java programs using any Java IDE or compiler.

## Problems

### I. Operations with data

**1. Average of the input numbers**

Write a program that takes three numbers from console as input to calculate and print output the average of the numbers.
Example of output:
First number - 6, second number - 4, third number - 7
Average - 5.6666665

**2. Operations on two input numbers**

Create Console Application project in Java.
In main() method write code for solving the next tasks:
- Define integer variables a and b. Read values a and b from Console and calculate: a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b.
- Output obtained results.
 
 **3. Read and output data**

Output question “How are you?“. Define string variable answer. Read the value answer and output: “You are (answer)".

**4. Output the input strings in the reverse order**  

Write a program that reads three strings and outputs them in the reverse order, each on a new line.
Example of output:  

**Input text:**

my

first

program

**Output text:**

program

first

my

**5. Multiplying two numbers**

Implement a function called multiply, which takes two numbers and returns their product:

multiply(2, 3) = 6

multiply(0, 188) = 0

multiply(85, 144) = 12240


### II. Remainder of the division

**1. Rearrangement of flowerpots and their position on a specific day**

On Christmas Eve, there were three flowers on the windowsill, from left to right: geranium, crocus, and violet.
Every morning, Masha wiped the window and swapped the flower on the right with the central flower.
And every evening, Tanya watered the flowers and swapped the left and central flowers.
It is required to determine the order of flowers at night after K days.

**Input:**
The input file INPUT.TXT contains a natural number K - the number of days (K ≤ 1000).

**Output:**
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you need to output three English letters: "G", "C", and "V" (capital letters without spaces),
describing the order of colors on the window after K days (from left to right). Denotations: G - geranium, C - crocus, V - violet.

**2. Sum of numbers except those dividing by 3**

Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100, excluding numbers that are divisible by 3 without a remainder.

### III. Practical tasks video with solutions

**1. Students**

Create a Console Application project. Add a class called Student to the project. The Student class should include:

✓ Two private fields: name and rating;

✓ Properties to access these fields;

✓ A default constructor and a constructor with parameters;

✓ A static method called avgRating() that calculates the average rating of all students;

✓ methods called:

- betterStudent(Student s) that determines which of two students is better (returns true or false);
- toString() that outputs information about the student.

In the main() method, create 3 objects of the Student type and input information about them.

Display the average and total rating of all students.
