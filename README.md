# Java Problem Solving

This repository contains solutions to various problems implemented in Java.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of Java programs solving different problems. Each problem is implemented in a separate Java file for clarity and organization.

## Folder Structure

- Each problem solution is contained within its own Java file.
- Files are named descriptively to indicate the problem they solve.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions provided in this repository. You can clone the repository locally and run the Java programs using any Java IDE or compiler.

## Problems

### Operations with data

- Average of the input numbers
 Write a program that takes three numbers from console as input to calculate and print output the average of the numbers.
 Example of output:
 First number - 6
 Second number - 4
 Third number - 7
 Average - 5.6666665

- Operations on two input numbers
  Create Console Application project in Java.
  In main() method write code for solving next tasks:
  1. Define integer variables a and b. Read values a and b from Console and calculate:
  • a + b
  • a - b
  • a * b
  • a / b.
  2. Output obtained results.
 
 - Read and output data
   Output question “How are you?“. Define string variable answer. Read the value answer and output: “You are (answer)".

 - Output the input strings in the reverse order  
   Write a program that reads three strings and outputs them in the reverse order, each on a new line.
   Example of output:  
   Input text:
   my
   first
   program
   Output text:
   program
   first
   my

### Remainder of the division

- Rearrangement of flowerpots and their position on a specific day

 On Christmas Eve, there were three flowers on the windowsill, from left to right: geranium, crocus, and violet.
 Every morning, Masha wiped the window and swapped the flower on the right with the central flower.
 And every evening, Tanya watered the flowers and swapped the left and central flowers.
 It is required to determine the order of flowers at night after K days.

 Input:
 The input file INPUT.TXT contains a natural number K - the number of days (K ≤ 1000).

 Output:
 In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you need to output three English letters: "G", "C", and "V" (capital letters without spaces),
 describing the order of colors on the window after K days (from left to right). Denotations: G - geranium, C - crocus, V - violet.

 - Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100, excluding numbers that are divisible by 3 without a remainder.
