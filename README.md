# Java Problem Solving

This repository contains solutions to various problems implemented in Java.

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of Java programs solving different problems. Each problem is implemented in a separate Java file for clarity and organization.

## Folder Structure

- Each problem solution is contained within its own Java file.
- Files are named descriptively to indicate the problem they solve.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions provided in this repository. You can clone the repository locally and run the Java programs using any Java IDE or compiler.

## Problems

### Operations with data

**1. <span style="color:green">Average of the input numbers</span>**
Write a program that takes three numbers from console as input to calculate and print output the average of the numbers.
Example of output:
First number - 6, second number - 4, third number - 7
Average - 5.6666665

**2. <span style="color:green">Operations on two input numbers</span>**
Create Console Application project in Java.
In main() method write code for solving the next tasks:
- Define integer variables a and b. Read values a and b from Console and calculate: a + b, a - b, a * b, a / b.
- Output obtained results.
 
 **3. <span style="color:green">Read and output data</span>**

Output question “How are you?“. Define string variable answer. Read the value answer and output: “You are (answer)".

**4. <span style="color:green">Output the input strings in the reverse order</span>**  
Write a program that reads three strings and outputs them in the reverse order, each on a new line.
Example of output:  
**Input text:**
my
first
program
**Output text:**
program
first
my

### Remainder of the division

**1. <span style="color:green">Rearrangement of flowerpots and their position on a specific day</span>**
On Christmas Eve, there were three flowers on the windowsill, from left to right: geranium, crocus, and violet.
Every morning, Masha wiped the window and swapped the flower on the right with the central flower.
And every evening, Tanya watered the flowers and swapped the left and central flowers.
It is required to determine the order of flowers at night after K days.
**Input:**
The input file INPUT.TXT contains a natural number K - the number of days (K ≤ 1000).
**Output:**
In the output file OUTPUT.TXT, you need to output three English letters: "G", "C", and "V" (capital letters without spaces),
describing the order of colors on the window after K days (from left to right). Denotations: G - geranium, C - crocus, V - violet.

**2. <span style="color:green">Sum of numbers except those dividing by 3</span>**

Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100, excluding numbers that are divisible by 3 without a remainder.
